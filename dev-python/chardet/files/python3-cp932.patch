+     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
+ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
+ as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
+ the version number 2.1.]
+
+			    Preamble
+
+  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
+Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
+free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
+
+  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
+specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
+Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
+can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
+this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
+strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
+
+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
+not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
+you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
+for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
+it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
+it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
+these things.
+
+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
+distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
+rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
+you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
+
+  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
+or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
+you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
+code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
+complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
+with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
+it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
+
+  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
+library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
+permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
+
+  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
+there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
+modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
+that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
+author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
+introduced by others.
+
+  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
+any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
+effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
+restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
+any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
+consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
+
+  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
+ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
+General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
+is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
+this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
+libraries into non-free programs.
+
+  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
+a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
+combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
+General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
+entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
+Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
+the library.
+
+  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
+does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
+Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
+of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
+are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
+libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
+special circumstances.
+
+  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
+encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
+a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
+allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
+library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
+case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
+software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
+
+  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
+programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
+free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
+non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
+operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
+system.
+
+  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
+users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
+linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
+that program using a modified version of the Library.
+
+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
+"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
+former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
+be combined with the library in order to run.
+
+		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
+program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
+other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
+this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
+Each licensee is addressed as "you".
+
+  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
+prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
+(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
+
+  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
+which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
+Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
+copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
+portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
+straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
+included without limitation in the term "modification".)
+
+  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
+making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
+all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
+interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
+and installation of the library.
+
+  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
+running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
+such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
+on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
+writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
+and what the program that uses the Library does.
+  
+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
+complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
+you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
+appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
+all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
+warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
+Library.
+
+  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
+and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
+fee.
+
+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
+of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
+
+    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
+    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
+
+    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
+    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
+    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
+    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
+    in the event an application does not supply such function or
+    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
+    its purpose remains meaningful.
+
+    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
+    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
+    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
+    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
+    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
+    root function must still compute square roots.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
+it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Library.
+
+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
+with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+the scope of this License.
+
+  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
+License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
+this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
+that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
+instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
+ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
+that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
+these notices.
+
+  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
+that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
+subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
+
+  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
+the Library into a program that is not a library.
+
+  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
+derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
+under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
+it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
+must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
+medium customarily used for software interchange.
+
+  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
+from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
+source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
+distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
+Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
+linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
+work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
+therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
+
+  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
+creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
+contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
+library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
+Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
+
+  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
+that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
+derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
+Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
+linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
+threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
+
+  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
+structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
+functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
+file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
+work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
+Library will still fall under Section 6.)
+
+  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
+distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
+Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
+whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
+
+  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
+link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
+work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
+under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
+modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
+engineering for debugging such modifications.
+
+  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
+Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
+this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
+during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
+copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
+directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
+of these things:
+
+    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
+    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
+    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
+    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
+    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
+    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
+    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
+    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
+    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
+    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
+    to use the modified definitions.)
+
+    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
+    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
+    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
+    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
+    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
+    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
+    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
+
+    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
+    least three years, to give the same user the materials
+    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
+    than the cost of performing this distribution.
+
+    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
+    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
+    specified materials from the same place.
+
+    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
+    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
+
+  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
+Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
+reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
+the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
+normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
+components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
+which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
+the executable.
+
+  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
+restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
+accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
+use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
+distribute.
+
+  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
+Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
+facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
+library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
+the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
+permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
+
+    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
+    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
+    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
+    Sections above.
+
+    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
+    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
+    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
+
+  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
+the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
+attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
+distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
+rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
+or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
+terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
+Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Library or works based on it.
+
+  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
+Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
+subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
+this License.
+
+  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
+
+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
+particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
+and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
+
+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
+integrity of the free software distribution system which is
+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
+impose that choice.
+
+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
+be a consequence of the rest of this License.
+
+  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
+original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
+an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
+so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
+excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
+written in the body of this License.
+
+  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
+versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
+Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
+but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
+
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
+"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
+conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
+the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
+license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
+the Free Software Foundation.
+
+  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
+programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
+write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
+copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
+Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
+decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
+of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
+and reuse of software generally.
+
+			    NO WARRANTY
+
+  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
+WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
+EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
+OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
+KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
+IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
+PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
+LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
+THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+
+  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
+WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
+AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
+FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
+CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
+LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
+RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
+FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
+SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
+DAMAGES.
+
+		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
+
+  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
+everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
+redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
+ordinary General Public License).
+
+  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
+safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
+"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
+
+    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
+    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
+    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
+    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
+    Lesser General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
+    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
+    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
+school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
+necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
+
+  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
+  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

+
+# This prober doesn't actually recognize a language or a charset.
+# It is a helper prober for the use of the Hebrew model probers
+
+### General ideas of the Hebrew charset recognition ###
+#
+# Four main charsets exist in Hebrew:
+# "ISO-8859-8" - Visual Hebrew
+# "windows-1255" - Logical Hebrew 
+# "ISO-8859-8-I" - Logical Hebrew
+# "x-mac-hebrew" - ?? Logical Hebrew ??
+#
+# Both "ISO" charsets use a completely identical set of code points, whereas
+# "windows-1255" and "x-mac-hebrew" are two different proper supersets of 
+# these code points. windows-1255 defines additional characters in the range
+# 0x80-0x9F as some misc punctuation marks as well as some Hebrew-specific 
+# diacritics and additional 'Yiddish' ligature letters in the range 0xc0-0xd6.
+# x-mac-hebrew defines similar additional code points but with a different 
+# mapping.
+#
+# As far as an average Hebrew text with no diacritics is concerned, all four 
+# charsets are identical with respect to code points. Meaning that for the 
+# main Hebrew alphabet, all four map the same values to all 27 Hebrew letters 
+# (including final letters).
+#
+# The dominant difference between these charsets is their directionality.
+# "Visual" directionality means that the text is ordered as if the renderer is
+# not aware of a BIDI rendering algorithm. The renderer sees the text and 
+# draws it from left to right. The text itself when ordered naturally is read 
+# backwards. A buffer of Visual Hebrew generally looks like so:
+# "[last word of first line spelled backwards] [whole line ordered backwards
+# and spelled backwards] [first word of first line spelled backwards] 
+# [end of line] [last word of second line] ... etc' "
+# adding punctuation marks, numbers and English text to visual text is
+# naturally also "visual" and from left to right.
+# 
+# "Logical" directionality means the text is ordered "naturally" according to
+# the order it is read. It is the responsibility of the renderer to display 
+# the text from right to left. A BIDI algorithm is used to place general 
+# punctuation marks, numbers and English text in the text.
+#
+# Texts in x-mac-hebrew are almost impossible to find on the Internet. From 
+# what little evidence I could find, it seems that its general directionality
+# is Logical.
+#
+# To sum up all of the above, the Hebrew probing mechanism knows about two
+# charsets:
+# Visual Hebrew - "ISO-8859-8" - backwards text - Words and sentences are
+#    backwards while line order is natural. For charset recognition purposes
+#    the line order is unimportant (In fact, for this implementation, even 
+#    word order is unimportant).
+# Logical Hebrew - "windows-1255" - normal, naturally ordered text.
+#
+# "ISO-8859-8-I" is a subset of windows-1255 and doesn't need to be 
+#    specifically identified.
+# "x-mac-hebrew" is also identified as windows-1255. A text in x-mac-hebrew
+#    that contain special punctuation marks or diacritics is displayed with
+#    some unconverted characters showing as question marks. This problem might
+#    be corrected using another model prober for x-mac-hebrew. Due to the fact
+#    that x-mac-hebrew texts are so rare, writing another model prober isn't 
+#    worth the effort and performance hit.
+#
+#### The Prober ####
+#
+# The prober is divided between two SBCharSetProbers and a HebrewProber,
+# all of which are managed, created, fed data, inquired and deleted by the
+# SBCSGroupProber. The two SBCharSetProbers identify that the text is in
+# fact some kind of Hebrew, Logical or Visual. The final decision about which
+# one is it is made by the HebrewProber by combining final-letter scores
+# with the scores of the two SBCharSetProbers to produce a final answer.
+#
+# The SBCSGroupProber is responsible for stripping the original text of HTML
+# tags, English characters, numbers, low-ASCII punctuation characters, spaces
+# and new lines. It reduces any sequence of such characters to a single space.
+# The buffer fed to each prober in the SBCS group prober is pure text in
+# high-ASCII.
+# The two SBCharSetProbers (model probers) share the same language model:
+# Win1255Model.
+# The first SBCharSetProber uses the model normally as any other
+# SBCharSetProber does, to recognize windows-1255, upon which this model was
+# built. The second SBCharSetProber is told to make the pair-of-letter
+# lookup in the language model backwards. This in practice exactly simulates
+# a visual Hebrew model using the windows-1255 logical Hebrew model.
+#
+# The HebrewProber is not using any language model. All it does is look for
+# final-letter evidence suggesting the text is either logical Hebrew or visual
+# Hebrew. Disjointed from the model probers, the results of the HebrewProber
+# alone are meaningless. HebrewProber always returns 0.00 as confidence
+# since it never identifies a charset by itself. Instead, the pointer to the
+# HebrewProber is passed to the model probers as a helper "Name Prober".
+# When the Group prober receives a positive identification from any prober,
+# it asks for the name of the charset identified. If the prober queried is a
+# Hebrew model prober, the model prober forwards the call to the
+# HebrewProber to make the final decision. In the HebrewProber, the
+# decision is made according to the final-letters scores maintained and Both
+# model probers scores. The answer is returned in the form of the name of the
+# charset identified, either "windows-1255" or "ISO-8859-8".

+<div></div>
+</div>
+<p>When you think of “<span class="quote">text</span>”, you probably think of “<span class="quote">characters and symbols I see on my computer screen</span>”.  But computers don’t deal in characters and symbols; they deal in bits and bytes.  Every piece of text you’ve ever seen on a computer screen is actually stored in a particular <span class="emphasis"><em>character encoding</em></span>.  There are many different character encodings, some optimized for particular languages like Russian or Chinese or English, and others that can be used for multiple languages.  Very roughly speaking, the character encoding provides a mapping between the stuff you see on your screen and the stuff your computer actually stores in memory and on disk.</p>
+<p>In reality, it’s more complicated than that.  Many characters are common to multiple encodings, but each encoding may use a different sequence of bytes to actually store those characters in memory or on disk.  So you can think of the character encoding as a kind of decryption key for the text.  Whenever someone gives you a sequence of bytes and claims it’s “<span class="quote">text</span>”, you need to know what character encoding they used so you can decode the bytes into characters and display them (or process them, or whatever).</p>
+</div>
+<div class="section" lang="en">
+<div class="titlepage">
+<div><div><h3 class="title">
+<a name="faq.what" class="skip" href="#faq.what" title="link to this section"><img src="images/permalink.gif" alt="[link]" title="link to this section" width="8" height="9"></a> What is character encoding auto-detection?</h3></div></div>
+<div></div>
+</div>
+<p>It means taking a sequence of bytes in an unknown character encoding, and attempting to determine the encoding so you can read the text.  It’s like cracking a code when you don’t have the decryption key.</p>
+</div>
+<div class="section" lang="en">

+<a name="faq.impossible" class="skip" href="#faq.impossible" title="link to this section"><img src="images/permalink.gif" alt="[link]" title="link to this section" width="8" height="9"></a> Isn’t that impossible?</h3></div></div>
+<div></div>
+</div>
+<p>In general, yes.  However, some encodings are optimized for specific languages, and languages are not random.  Some character sequences pop up all the time, while other sequences make no sense.  A person fluent in English who opens a newspaper and finds “<span class="quote">txzqJv 2!dasd0a QqdKjvz</span>” will instantly recognize that that isn’t English (even though it is composed entirely of English letters).  By studying lots of “<span class="quote">typical</span>” text, a computer algorithm can simulate this kind of fluency and make an educated guess about a text’s language.</p>
+<p>In other words, encoding detection is really language detection, combined with knowledge of which languages tend to use which character encodings.</p>

+<div></div>
+</div>
+<p>This library is a port of <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/extensions/universalchardet/src/base/">the auto-detection code in Mozilla</a>.  I have attempted to maintain as much of the original structure as possible (mostly for selfish reasons, to make it easier to maintain the port as the original code evolves).  I have also retained the original authors’ comments, which are quite extensive and informative.</p>
+<p>You may also be interested in the research paper which led to the Mozilla implementation, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/UniversalCharsetDetection.html">A composite approach to language/encoding detection</a>.</p>

+<div></div>
+</div>
+<p>Don’t do that.  Virtually every format and protocol contains a method for specifying character encoding.</p>
+<div class="itemizedlist"><ul>
+<li>HTTP can define a <tt class="literal">charset</tt> parameter in the <tt class="literal">Content-type</tt> header.</li>
+<li>HTML documents can define a <tt class="literal">&lt;meta http-equiv="content-type"&gt;</tt> element in the <tt class="literal">&lt;head&gt;</tt> of a web page.</li>
+<li>XML documents can define an <tt class="literal">encoding</tt> attribute in the XML prolog.</li>
+</ul></div>
+<p>If text comes with explicit character encoding information, you should use it.  If the text has no explicit information, but the relevant standard defines a default encoding, you should use that.  (This is harder than it sounds, because standards can overlap.  If you fetch an XML document over HTTP, you need to support both standards <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> figure out which one wins if they give you conflicting information.)</p>
+<p>Despite the complexity, it’s worthwhile to follow standards and <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/mime-respect">respect explicit character encoding information</a>.  It will almost certainly be faster and more accurate than trying to auto-detect the encoding.  It will also make the world a better place, since your program will interoperate with other programs that follow the same standards.</p>
+</div>

+<div><div><h3 class="title">
+<a name="faq.why" class="skip" href="#faq.why" title="link to this section"><img src="images/permalink.gif" alt="[link]" title="link to this section" width="8" height="9"></a> Why bother with auto-detection if it’s slow, inaccurate, and non-standard?</h3></div></div>
+<div></div>
+</div>
+<p>Sometimes you receive text with verifiably inaccurate encoding information.  Or text without any encoding information, and the specified default encoding doesn’t work.  There are also some poorly designed standards that have no way to specify encoding at all.</p>
+<p>If following the relevant standards gets you nowhere, <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> you decide that processing the text is more important than maintaining interoperability, then you can try to auto-detect the character encoding as a last resort.  An example is my <a href="http://feedparser.org/">Universal Feed Parser</a>, which calls this auto-detection library <a href="http://feedparser.org/docs/character-encoding.html">only after exhausting all other options</a>.</p>

+<div><div class="abstract">
+<h3 class="title"></h3>
+<p>This is a brief guide to navigating the code itself.</p>
+</div></div>
+</div>
+<div></div>
+</div>
+<p>First, you should read <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/UniversalCharsetDetection.html">A composite approach to language/encoding detection</a>, which explains the detection algorithm and how it was derived.  This will help you later when you stumble across the huge character frequency distribution tables like <tt class="filename">big5freq.py</tt> and language models like <tt class="filename">langcyrillicmodel.py</tt>.</p>
+<p>The main entry point for the detection algorithm is <tt class="filename">universaldetector.py</tt>, which has one class, <tt class="classname">UniversalDetector</tt>.  (You might think the main entry point is the <tt class="function">detect</tt> function in <tt class="filename">chardet/__init__.py</tt>, but that’s really just a convenience function that creates a <tt class="classname">UniversalDetector</tt> object, calls it, and returns its result.)</p>
+<p>There are 5 categories of encodings that <tt class="classname">UniversalDetector</tt> handles:</p>
+<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
+<li>
+<tt class="literal">UTF-n</tt> with a <acronym title="Byte Order Mark">BOM</acronym>.  This includes <tt class="literal">UTF-8</tt>, both <acronym title="Big Endian">BE</acronym> and <acronym title="Little Endian">LE</acronym> variants of <tt class="literal">UTF-16</tt>, and all 4 byte-order variants of <tt class="literal">UTF-32</tt>.</li>
+<li>Escaped encodings, which are entirely 7-bit <acronym>ASCII</acronym> compatible, where non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters start with an escape sequence.  Examples: <tt class="literal">ISO-2022-JP</tt> (Japanese) and <tt class="literal">HZ-GB-2312</tt> (Chinese).</li>
+<li>Multi-byte encodings, where each character is represented by a variable number of bytes.  Examples: <tt class="literal">Big5</tt> (Chinese), <tt class="literal">SHIFT_JIS</tt> (Japanese), <tt class="literal">EUC-KR</tt> (Korean), and <tt class="literal">UTF-8</tt> without a <acronym title="Byte Order Mark">BOM</acronym>.</li>
+<li>Single-byte encodings, where each character is represented by one byte.  Examples: <tt class="literal">KOI8-R</tt> (Russian), <tt class="literal">windows-1255</tt> (Hebrew), and <tt class="literal">TIS-620</tt> (Thai).</li>
+<li>
+<tt class="literal">windows-1252</tt>, which is used primarily on Microsoft Windows by middle managers who don’t know a character encoding from a hole in the ground.</li>
+</ol></div>
+<div class="section" lang="en">
+<div class="titlepage">
+<div><div><h3 class="title">
+<a name="how.bom" class="skip" href="#how.bom" title="link to this section"><img src="images/permalink.gif" alt="[link]" title="link to this section" width="8" height="9"></a> <tt class="literal">UTF-n</tt> with a <acronym title="Byte Order Mark">BOM</acronym>
+</h3></div></div>
+<div></div>
+</div>
+<p>If the text starts with a <acronym title="Byte Order Mark">BOM</acronym>, we can reasonably assume that the text is encoded in <tt class="literal">UTF-8</tt>, <tt class="literal">UTF-16</tt>, or <tt class="literal">UTF-32</tt>.  (The <acronym title="Byte Order Mark">BOM</acronym> will tell us exactly which one; that’s what it’s for.)  This is handled inline in <tt class="classname">UniversalDetector</tt>, which returns the result immediately without any further processing.</p>
+</div>
+<div class="section" lang="en">
+<div class="titlepage">
+<div><div><h3 class="title">
+<a name="how.esc" class="skip" href="#how.esc" title="link to this section"><img src="images/permalink.gif" alt="[link]" title="link to this section" width="8" height="9"></a> Escaped encodings</h3></div></div>
+<div></div>
+</div>
+<p>If the text contains a recognizable escape sequence that might indicate an escaped encoding, <tt class="classname">UniversalDetector</tt> creates an <tt class="classname">EscCharSetProber</tt> (defined in <tt class="filename">escprober.py</tt>) and feeds it the text.</p>
+<p><tt class="classname">EscCharSetProber</tt> creates a series of state machines, based on models of <tt class="literal">HZ-GB-2312</tt>, <tt class="literal">ISO-2022-CN</tt>, <tt class="literal">ISO-2022-JP</tt>, and <tt class="literal">ISO-2022-KR</tt> (defined in <tt class="filename">escsm.py</tt>).  <tt class="classname">EscCharSetProber</tt> feeds the text to each of these state machines, one byte at a time.  If any state machine ends up uniquely identifying the encoding, <tt class="classname">EscCharSetProber</tt> immediately returns the positive result to <tt class="classname">UniversalDetector</tt>, which returns it to the caller.  If any state machine hits an illegal sequence, it is dropped and processing continues with the other state machines.</p>
+</div>
+<div class="section" lang="en">
+<div class="titlepage">
+<div><div><h3 class="title">
+<a name="how.mb" class="skip" href="#how.mb" title="link to this section"><img src="images/permalink.gif" alt="[link]" title="link to this section" width="8" height="9"></a> Multi-byte encodings</h3></div></div>
+<div></div>
+</div>
+<p>Assuming no <acronym title="Byte Order Mark">BOM</acronym>, <tt class="classname">UniversalDetector</tt> checks whether the text contains any high-bit characters.  If so, it creates a series of “<span class="quote">probers</span>” for detecting multi-byte encodings, single-byte encodings, and as a last resort, <tt class="literal">windows-1252</tt>.</p>
+<p>The multi-byte encoding prober, <tt class="classname">MBCSGroupProber</tt> (defined in <tt class="filename">mbcsgroupprober.py</tt>), is really just a shell that manages a group of other probers, one for each multi-byte encoding: <tt class="literal">Big5</tt>, <tt class="literal">GB2312</tt>, <tt class="literal">EUC-TW</tt>, <tt class="literal">EUC-KR</tt>, <tt class="literal">EUC-JP</tt>, <tt class="literal">SHIFT_JIS</tt>, and <tt class="literal">UTF-8</tt>.  <tt class="classname">MBCSGroupProber</tt> feeds the text to each of these encoding-specific probers and checks the results.  If a prober reports that it has found an illegal byte sequence, it is dropped from further processing (so that, for instance, any subsequent calls to <tt class="classname">UniversalDetector</tt>.<tt class="methodname">feed</tt> will skip that prober).  If a prober reports that it is reasonably confident that it has detected the encoding, <tt class="classname">MBCSGroupProber</tt> reports this positive result to <tt class="classname">UniversalDetector</tt>, which reports the result to the caller.</p>
+<p>Most of the multi-byte encoding probers are inherited from <tt class="classname">MultiByteCharSetProber</tt> (defined in <tt class="filename">mbcharsetprober.py</tt>), and simply hook up the appropriate state machine and distribution analyzer and let <tt class="classname">MultiByteCharSetProber</tt> do the rest of the work.  <tt class="classname">MultiByteCharSetProber</tt> runs the text through the encoding-specific state machine, one byte at a time, to look for byte sequences that would indicate a conclusive positive or negative result.  At the same time, <tt class="classname">MultiByteCharSetProber</tt> feeds the text to an encoding-specific distribution analyzer.</p>
+<p>The distribution analyzers (each defined in <tt class="filename">chardistribution.py</tt>) use language-specific models of which characters are used most frequently.  Once <tt class="classname">MultiByteCharSetProber</tt> has fed enough text to the distribution analyzer, it calculates a confidence rating based on the number of frequently-used characters, the total number of characters, and a language-specific distribution ratio.  If the confidence is high enough, <tt class="classname">MultiByteCharSetProber</tt> returns the result to <tt class="classname">MBCSGroupProber</tt>, which returns it to <tt class="classname">UniversalDetector</tt>, which returns it to the caller.</p>
+<p>The case of Japanese is more difficult.  Single-character distribution analysis is not always sufficient to distinguish between <tt class="literal">EUC-JP</tt> and <tt class="literal">SHIFT_JIS</tt>, so the <tt class="classname">SJISProber</tt> (defined in <tt class="filename">sjisprober.py</tt>) also uses 2-character distribution analysis.  <tt class="classname">SJISContextAnalysis</tt> and <tt class="classname">EUCJPContextAnalysis</tt> (both defined in <tt class="filename">jpcntx.py</tt> and both inheriting from a common <tt class="classname">JapaneseContextAnalysis</tt> class) check the frequency of Hiragana syllabary characters within the text.  Once enough text has been processed, they return a confidence level to <tt class="classname">SJISProber</tt>, which checks both analyzers and returns the higher confidence level to <tt class="classname">MBCSGroupProber</tt>.</p>

+<a name="how.sb" class="skip" href="#how.sb" title="link to this section"><img src="images/permalink.gif" alt="[link]" title="link to this section" width="8" height="9"></a> Single-byte encodings</h3></div></div>
+<div></div>
+</div>
+<p>The single-byte encoding prober, <tt class="classname">SBCSGroupProber</tt> (defined in <tt class="filename">sbcsgroupprober.py</tt>), is also just a shell that manages a group of other probers, one for each combination of single-byte encoding and language: <tt class="literal">windows-1251</tt>, <tt class="literal">KOI8-R</tt>, <tt class="literal">ISO-8859-5</tt>, <tt class="literal">MacCyrillic</tt>, <tt class="literal">IBM855</tt>, and <tt class="literal">IBM866</tt> (Russian); <tt class="literal">ISO-8859-7</tt> and <tt class="literal">windows-1253</tt> (Greek); <tt class="literal">ISO-8859-5</tt> and <tt class="literal">windows-1251</tt> (Bulgarian); <tt class="literal">ISO-8859-2</tt> and <tt class="literal">windows-1250</tt> (Hungarian); <tt class="literal">TIS-620</tt> (Thai); <tt class="literal">windows-1255</tt> and <tt class="literal">ISO-8859-8</tt> (Hebrew).</p>
+<p><tt class="classname">SBCSGroupProber</tt> feeds the text to each of these encoding+language-specific probers and checks the results.  These probers are all implemented as a single class, <tt class="classname">SingleByteCharSetProber</tt> (defined in <tt class="filename">sbcharsetprober.py</tt>), which takes a language model as an argument.  The language model defines how frequently different 2-character sequences appear in typical text.  <tt class="classname">SingleByteCharSetProber</tt> processes the text and tallies the most frequently used 2-character sequences.  Once enough text has been processed, it calculates a confidence level based on the number of frequently-used sequences, the total number of characters, and a language-specific distribution ratio.</p>
+<p>Hebrew is handled as a special case.  If the text appears to be Hebrew based on 2-character distribution analysis, <tt class="classname">HebrewProber</tt> (defined in <tt class="filename">hebrewprober.py</tt>) tries to distinguish between Visual Hebrew (where the source text actually stored “<span class="quote">backwards</span>” line-by-line, and then displayed verbatim so it can be read from right to left) and Logical Hebrew (where the source text is stored in reading order and then rendered right-to-left by the client).  Because certain characters are encoded differently based on whether they appear in the middle of or at the end of a word, we can make a reasonable guess about direction of the source text, and return the appropriate encoding (<tt class="literal">windows-1255</tt> for Logical Hebrew, or <tt class="literal">ISO-8859-8</tt> for Visual Hebrew).</p>
+</div>
+<div class="section" lang="en">

+<a name="how.windows1252" class="skip" href="#how.windows1252" title="link to this section"><img src="images/permalink.gif" alt="[link]" title="link to this section" width="8" height="9"></a> windows-1252</h3></div></div>
+<div></div>
+</div>
+<p>If <tt class="classname">UniversalDetector</tt> detects a high-bit character in the text, but none of the other multi-byte or single-byte encoding probers return a confident result, it creates a <tt class="classname">Latin1Prober</tt> (defined in <tt class="filename">latin1prober.py</tt>) to try to detect English text in a <tt class="literal">windows-1252</tt> encoding.  This detection is inherently unreliable, because English letters are encoded in the same way in many different encodings.  The only way to distinguish <tt class="literal">windows-1252</tt> is through commonly used symbols like smart quotes, curly apostrophes, copyright symbols, and the like.  <tt class="classname">Latin1Prober</tt> automatically reduces its confidence rating to allow more accurate probers to win if at all possible.</p>

+<p>The <tt class="function">detect</tt> function takes one argument, a non-Unicode string.  It returns a dictionary containing the auto-detected character encoding and a confidence level from <tt class="constant">0</tt> to <tt class="constant">1</tt>.</p>
+<pre class="screen"><tt class="prompt">&gt;&gt;&gt; </tt><span class="userinput"><font color='navy'><b>import</b></font> urllib</span>

+<div></div>
+</div>
+<p>If you’re dealing with a large amount of text, you can call the <span class="application">Universal Encoding Detector</span> library incrementally, and it will stop as soon as it is confident enough to report its results.</p>
+<p>Create a <tt class="classname">UniversalDetector</tt> object, then call its <tt class="methodname">feed</tt> method repeatedly with each block of text.  If the detector reaches a minimum threshold of confidence, it will set <tt class="varname">detector.done</tt> to <tt class="constant">True</tt>.</p>
+<p>Once you’ve exhausted the source text, call <tt class="methodname">detector.close()</tt>, which will do some final calculations in case the detector didn’t hit its minimum confidence threshold earlier.  Then <tt class="varname">detector.result</tt> will be a dictionary containing the auto-detected character encoding and confidence level (the same as <a href="usage.html#example.basic.detect" title="Example: Using the detect function">the <tt class="function">chardet.detect</tt> function returns</a>).</p>

+</div>
+<p>If you want to detect the encoding of multiple texts (such as separate files), you can re-use a single <tt class="classname">UniversalDetector</tt> object.  Just call <tt class="methodname">detector.reset()</tt> at the start of each file, call <tt class="methodname">detector.feed</tt> as many times as you like, and then call <tt class="methodname">detector.close()</tt> and check the <tt class="varname">detector.result</tt> dictionary for the file’s results.</p>

+<p>I see America drinking... the fabulous cocktails I make.<br />
+America's getting stinking on something I stir or shake<br />
+The Sex on the Beach... the schnapps made from peach... the Velvet Hammer, the Alabama Slammer.<br />
+I make things with juice and froth... the Pink Squirrel, the Three-Toed Sloth.<br />
+I make drinks so sweet and snazzy... the Ice-T, Kamikaze.<br />
+The Orgasm.<br />
+The Death Spasm.<br />
+The Singapore Sling, the Ding-a-ling.<br />
+America, you're just devoted... to every flavor I've got.<br />
+But if you want to get loaded... why don't you just order a shot?<hr /><strong>ZbNXEIEUEr[`</strong><br />
